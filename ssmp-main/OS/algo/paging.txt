Algorithm
1. Start
2. Read the MEMORYSIZE and PAGESIZE
3. Calculate PAGECOUNT = MEMORYSIZE/PAGESIZE
4. Read the no:of processes in PROCESSCOUNT
5. Read the no:of pages required by each process in REQUIREMENT array and associated page table in PAGETABLE
6. Read the process number and logical address in terms of pagenumber and pageoffset to calculate physical address
7. Calculate physical address by pagenumber*pagesize+pageoffset
8. End
