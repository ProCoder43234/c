Multi-level
Algorithm
1. Start
2. Read the no:of processes N
3. Read the arrival time, burst time and process type (system/user) value of each process in an array
4. Read the time quantum QUANTUM for the process
5. Initialise SUM,TURNAROUNDTIME,WAITINGTIME to 0
6. Initialise COMPLETED to 0
7. While COMPLETED is not equal to N
8. Begin:
9. Choose an unfinished system process from array at time SUM if available. Else choose a process on fcfs priority.
10. If arrival time of PROCESS is greater than SUM, set SUM to arrival time
11. If burst time of PROCESS is less than QUANTUM:
12. Begin:
13. Add the value of PROCESS burst time to SUM
14. Calculate process turnaround time tat by (sum-PROCESS arrival time)
15. Calculate process waiting time wt by (tat-PROCESS burst time)
16. Add the value of tat to TURNAROUNDTIME
17. Add the value of wt to WAITINGTIME
18. Increment the value of COMPLETED
19. End:
20. Else:
21. Begin:
22. Decrement the value of QUANTUM from PROCESS burst time
23. Add the value of QUANTUM to SUM
24. End:
25. End:
26. Calculate average turnaround time by TURNAROUNDTIME/N
27. Calculate average waiting time by WAITINGTIME/N
28. End
