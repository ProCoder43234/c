FCFS
Algorithm
1. Start
2. Read the no:of processes N
3. Read the arrival time and burst time of each process in an array
4. Initialise SUM,TURNAROUNDTIME,WAITINGTIME to 0
5. For each process in array:
6. Begin:
7. Add the value of process burst time to sum
8. Calculate process turnaround time tat by (sum-process arrival time) 9. Calculate process waiting time wt by (tat-process burst time)
10. Add the value of tat to TURNAROUNDTIME
11. Add the value of wt to WAITINGTIME
12. End:
13. Calculate average turnaround time by TURNAROUNDTIME/N 14. Calculate average waiting time by WAITINGTIME/N
15. End
