Priority
Algorithm
1. Start
2. Read the no:of processes N
3. Read the arrival time, burst time and priority of each process in an array 4. Initialise SUM,TURNAROUNDTIME,WAITINGTIME to 0
5. Initialise COMPLETED to 0
6. While COMPLETED is not equal to N
7. Begin:
8. Find the PROCESS with biggest priority at time = SUM
9. If such a process does not exist, increment the value of SUM
10. Else:
11. Begin:
12. Add the value of PROCESS burst time to SUM
13. Calculate process turnaround time tat by (sum-PROCESS arrival time) 14. Calculate process waiting time wt by (tat-PROCESS burst time)
15. Add the value of tat to TURNAROUNDTIME
16. Add the value of wt to WAITINGTIME
17. Increment the value of COMPLETED
18. End:
19. End:
20. Calculate average turnaround time by TURNAROUNDTIME/N
21. Calculate average waiting time by WAITINGTIME/N
22. End
